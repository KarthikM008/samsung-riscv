# Instruction Types and Fields:- Of factorial of a number

The RISC-V instructions are categorized into types based on their field organization. Each type has specific
fields like opcode, func3, func7, immediate values, and register numbers. The types include:

R-type: Register type

I-type: Immediate type

S-type: Store type

B-type: Branch type

U-type: Upper immediate type

J-type: Jump type
